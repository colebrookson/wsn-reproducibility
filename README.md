# Reproducibility for *Self*, reproducibility for *All*

The content in this repository is for the workshop on reproducibility in R, given at the Western Society of Naturalists meeting, November 09, 2023. 

## Setting Up Our Working Directory

Start by selecting somewhere on your computer for this directory to live. It usually make sense to keep all your folders for different projects in the same place. So we're all on the same page, we suggest naming it `wsn-reproducibility`. Now, we'll be making some folders to keep our files in. We'll make three folders to start: 

* `/data`
* `/R`
* `/outputs`

These three are the basis of most analysis projects. Next, we'll make an RProject. To do this, open RStudio, then click *File > New Project > Existing Directory*, then use the *Browse...* button to navigate in your folder structure and select the `wsn-reproducibility` folder.
